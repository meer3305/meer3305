## 🧠 About Me

I am a **3rd year Computer Science and Engineering student at MJCET**, focused on building **scalable, production grade AI systems**. I currently serve as the **Tech Captain of CSI MJCET**, where I lead technical initiatives, mentor students, and drive innovation within the campus tech ecosystem.

I have **hands on experience with 15+ Machine Learning, Ai agents and Computer Vision projects**, working across the **entire AI lifecycle**  data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and monitoring. My strongest interests lie in **Agentic AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM fine-tuning, and AI system design at scale**.

Backed by **strong Computer Science fundamentals**  **Data Structure and Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Data Base Management Systems, and Computer Networks**  I approach AI with an **engineering first mindset**, emphasizing correctness, efficiency, scalability, and reliability. I am currently expanding into **Full Stack Web Development** to build **end to end AI powered platforms**.

## 🧠 How I Think as an AI Engineer

> *Engineering first. Systems oriented. Production aware.*

---

### ⚙️ Systems & Engineering Mindset
- I treat **AI as a system problem**, not just a modeling problem  data, infrastructure, evaluation, and deployment matter more than algorithms alone.
- I design AI solutions **assuming failure**, planning for observability, fallback mechanisms, and graceful degradation.
- I think in terms of **latency, throughput, cost, and reliability**, not just accuracy.

---

### 📊 Data & Modeling Philosophy
- I prioritize **data quality and distribution awareness** over chasing marginal metric improvements.
- I believe **feature engineering and robust data pipelines** often outperform complex model architectures.
- I validate models using **real-world evaluation scenarios**, not only offline benchmarks.

---

### 🤖 LLM & Generative AI Thinking
- I treat **LLMs as probabilistic reasoning engines**, not deterministic APIs.
- I focus on **prompt structure, retrieval quality, and context control** before considering fine tuning.
- I design **RAG systems** with retrieval precision, grounding, and hallucination control as first class concerns.

---

### 🧩 Agentic AI & Automation
- I design agents to be **tool driven and goal aware**, not prompt-heavy.
- I believe effective agents require **state, memory, constraints, and clear termination logic**.
- I prefer **composable agents** over monolithic autonomous systems.

---

### 🧠 Computer Science Foundations
- I use **DSA** to reason about performance and scalability in AI pipelines.
- I rely on **Operating Systems concepts** to understand concurrency, memory, and scheduling in AI workloads.
- I apply **DBMS and Computer Networks fundamentals** when designing distributed AI systems.

---

### 🚀 Production & Deployment
- I design models assuming they will run in **resource constrained environments**.
- I favor **simple, maintainable solutions** over over-engineered architectures.
- I treat **monitoring, logging, and retraining** as part of the model lifecycle, not an afterthought.

---

### 📈 Learning & Growth
- I learn by **building, breaking, and iterating**, rather than memorizing frameworks.
- I study **research papers for ideas**, but implement **engineering solutions for real world impact**.
- I continuously refine my understanding by **teaching, mentoring, and collaborating with others**.
